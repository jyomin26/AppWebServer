# AppWebServer
Creating webserver within android application while working with IOT projects.

This Sample has a webserver class that acts as a Server, which can be added in any module, and access its api using any library. I used AndroidNetworking library in the Main class, you can use retro , volley whichever meets your requirements to access the Webserver by passing the correct URL.
